Image classification with Deep Learning using TensorFlow and Keras.  
Made for Shopee Code League 2020.


### Note
My first attempt in machine learning with TensorFlow.  
It is a simple linear sequential model, with several layers of convolution layers...  
It plateaued at a training accuracy of 77% but achieved only 38% validation accuracy.  
Yes, I'm aware it is severely overfitted and I am pretty much horrible at this.
